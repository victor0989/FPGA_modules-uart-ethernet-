# FPGA_modules-uart-ethernet  
This repository contains VHDL modules for FPGA development, focusing on UART, Ethernet, GPIO, and SPI protocols, as well as C modules for the ESP32 platform using PlatformIO.  

It serves as a collection of small projects and ideas for signal processing and peripheral interfacing.  

## Module Examples  

### 1. UART Module  
A module that handles asynchronous serial communication, enabling data transmission and reception via the UART interface.  

### 2. SPI Module  
A module that implements the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol, facilitating communication with external devices such as sensors and memory.  

### 3. GPIO Module  
A module for controlling General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins, allowing configuration and handling of digital signals.  

### 4. Ethernet Module  
A module that manages Ethernet communication, enabling data transmission over local networks.  

### 5. LFSR4Bit Module  
A module that implements a 4-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register, useful for generating pseudo-random sequences.  

### 6. Sensor Interface Module  
A module designed to interact with a specific sensor, processing and transmitting received signals for further analysis.
